First, to set the correct path for test files, go to line 742 of tableTest.f08 and adjust 

	character(len=*), parameter :: file_path

as needed. Whatever console output is used later will fill the remainder of file_path.


To compile:
	gfortran tableTest.f08 -o tableTest

To run:
	tableTest
	   ~or~
	tableTest RemainingFilePath
