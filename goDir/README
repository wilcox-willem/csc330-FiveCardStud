My impressions/notes of Go:

	- It's like the nice parts of java, c++, and python got blended
	  together

	- I think this would be a great language to teach data structures in.
	  It is really powerful, helpful, and a lot easier to debug than c++

	- I like the structure and use of {} without heavy use of ;'s! 
	  ;'s tend to get on my nerves, sometimes, I code on a 4k tv 
	  so I can have more windows open, and it gets really tricky 
	  spotting the 2 pixel difference between ; : (sometimes I think it's
	  dust or something on the screen)

	- Go seems like a language perfect for speedsters and back room devs

	- I still like perl more
