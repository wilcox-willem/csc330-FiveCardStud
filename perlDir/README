My impressions/notes of perl:

	- Honestly, I thought it was going to take a while to get comfy
	  but Perl has a lot of really fun and refreshing features and tools.
	  Furthermore, I enjoy the use of $ and @ (helps me make read/remember), 
	  as well as learning more about how Perl works behind the scenes 
	  to pull it all off. I think its really cool and it's been the
	  easiest for me to pick up. Julia is also really nice, but man,
	  Perl just scratches an itch I didn't know I had haha

	- I found a book on learning/using Perl, it's called 
			"Perl Cookbook" by Tom Christiansen & Nathan Torkington
	  Here is a link I found for it as well, it was really helpful for me
	  		https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~bmg/software/Perl%20Books/OReilly.Perl.Cookbook.pdf
	  Furthermore, I would reccomend others to give it a read!

	  One of the things I really enjoy about it, is that it introduces
	  concepts via this formula:
	  		1. Problem : real example to bring context
	  		2. Solution : need I say more?
	  		3. Discussion : ^ look above ^
	  		4. See Also : more context and resources
	  Now, it is a little dated (1998, but thats up to V. 5.05)

	  Overall, it helped me wrap my head around things and I like
	  the way they structured the book!

	- This version of the project was also the easiest to debug!
	  The hardest thing for me was understanding how to pass values
	  to subroutines via @_ but after messing around with it, I'm
	  suprisingly happy with how it works. It's kinda cool

	  There were a lot of moments where I wish I could have spent longer
	  to explore more cool features and uses. I'm going to comeback to
	  Perl for a homebrew project of somesorts though

	- Below are two WONDERFUL youtube videos, the creators
	  are fantastic as well. Fireship has a lot of "_ in 100 seconds"
	  videos, that have been great for getting a quick overview of
	  just about any language you could think of. Furthermore,
	  you dive int to Derek Banas' "Learn _ in one video" for an
	  hour long dive into a multitude of useful features for starting
	  out in a new language. Together, you can get a massive head
	  start! They make these videos for all sorts of languages and
	  adjacent topics as well. They have been monumental for me in
	  this class

	  	(Fun fact: he uses a "hi mom" instead of a "hello world" in every
	  	 videos he makes. He does it for his mom, because she watches all 
	  	 of his videos)
