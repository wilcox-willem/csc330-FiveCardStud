To compile, use 'julia name_of_file.jl'

To include one file into another, use 'include("name_of_file.jl")' at the top,
then below that use 'using ..ModuleName'
as well as, use 'ModuleName.moduleFunction()' to use the functions of said file



"/home/wilcox_we/csc330/FCWW/handsets/tester_rsf" is a known good file location!
use this with import_deck to return a 2d array of cards


c to make hands

newCard = create_card_str(string(cardStrings[currentCard]))
                hands[i, j] = newCard
